# Fastify Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a Fastify-based API as an alternative to the Next.js API routes to evaluate performance and developer experience differences.

## Goals
- Create a new Fastify app in the monorepo structure
- Implement health check endpoint matching existing functionality
- Configure CORS to match current settings
- Update render.yaml to support deploying the Fastify API
- Provide easy configuration to switch between Next.js and Fastify APIs

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new Fastify app in apps/fastify-api directory
2. Implement health check endpoint matching current functionality
3. Configure CORS settings to match existing implementation
4. Set up environment variable configuration for API selection
5. Update render.yaml to include Fastify API deployment
6. Create documentation on how to switch between APIs

## Testing Strategy
- Verify health endpoint works locally with equivalent functionality
- Test CORS configuration
- Benchmark performance comparison between Next.js and Fastify APIs

## Questions to Resolve
- How should we structure environment variables to control which API is used?
- What dependencies/integrations need to be maintained between implementations?
- Should we implement additional endpoints beyond health check for thorough comparison?
