# âœ… COMPLETED: Fix ESLint Issues in Packages

## Initial Issue

In this turborepo app with TypeScript, ESLint support was not working in Cursor in the packages/ folders which all use TypeScript.

## Issues Identified

The key issues identified were:

1. ESLint configurations in packages lacked proper TypeScript project references
2. The UI package's ESLint configuration needed additional React-specific settings
3. The turbo generator files in packages/ui were causing ESLint errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added TypeScript Project References to ESLint Configs

Updated the ESLint configurations in packages to include proper TypeScript project references:

**packages/api-types/eslint.config.mjs**:
```javascript
{
  files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      project: "./tsconfig.json"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Added React-Specific Configuration for UI Package

Enhanced the UI package's ESLint configuration with React-specific settings:

**packages/ui/eslint.config.mjs**:
```javascript
{
  files: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
  ignores: ["turbo/**"],
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      project: "./tsconfig.json",
      ecmaFeatures: {
        jsx: true
      }
    }
  },
  settings: {
    react: {
      version: "detect"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Excluded Turbo Generator Files

Added a specific ignore pattern for the turbo generator files in the UI package:

```javascript
ignores: ["turbo/**"]
```

### 4. Added VSCode/Cursor Integration Settings

Enhanced the `.vscode/settings.json` file for better editor integration:

```json
{
  "eslint.workingDirectories": [
    {
      "mode": "auto"
    }
  ],
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "typescript",
    "typescriptreact"
  ]
}
```

### 5. Updated README.md

Clarified the code quality workflow in the README.md, emphasizing the automatic code formatting feature that requires no setup.

## Understanding of Code Quality Workflow

This repository uses a clear separation of responsibilities:

1. **ESLint** for code quality checks (with formatting rules disabled)  
2. **Prettier** exclusively for code formatting, running automatically on save  
3. No manual editor configuration needed - it "just works"

## Verification

All packages now pass ESLint checks:

```bash
pnpm lint  # Runs successfully for all packages
```

## Why ESLint Support Was Missing in Cursor for `packages/` in a Turborepo with TypeScript

This is a common issue in Turborepo monorepos, especially when using TypeScript and shared ESLint configurations. The main causes are typically:

- ESLint and/or your editor (like VSCode or Cursor) not resolving the correct ESLint config or TypeScript settings for files inside `packages/`.
- Path aliases or project references in TypeScript not being picked up by ESLint or your IDE, even though TypeScript itself works fine[1].

Below are the most likely causes and solutions, based on current best practices and recent discussions.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**1. ESLint Configuration Not Propagating to Packages**

If you have a central ESLint config (e.g., in `packages/eslint-config`), you must ensure each package in `packages/` extends or imports this config. With ESLint v9 (Flat Config), each package should have its own `eslint.config.js` that imports from your shared config[4][2].

**Example:**

```js
// packages/my-lib/eslint.config.js
import { baseConfig } from "@repo/eslint-config/base.js";
export default [
  ...baseConfig,
  // package-specific rules here
];
```

Make sure all ESLint dependencies are installed in the config package and not duplicated elsewhere[4][5].

**2. Editor Integration (Cursor/VSCode) Not Picking Up the Right Config**

Your editor may not automatically detect the right ESLint config or TypeScript project for files inside `packages/`. To fix this:

- Add a `.vscode/settings.json` (or equivalent for Cursor) at the root with:

  ```json
  {
    "eslint.workingDirectories": [{ "mode": "auto" }]
  }
  ```

  This helps ESLint and your editor know to treat each package as its own working directory[3].

- If you use project references or custom `tsconfig.json` in each package, ensure your ESLint config in each package sets:
  ```js
  parserOptions: {
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    project: './tsconfig.json'
  }
  ```
  This is especially important for TypeScript rules to work in editors[3].

**3. Path Aliases Not Being Resolved**

If you use TypeScript path aliases (e.g., `@myorg/utils`), ESLint and your editor may not resolve them unless:

- Your `tsconfig.json` in each package correctly extends the root config and includes the right paths[1].
- You have the `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` plugin configured in your ESLint config to help ESLint resolve TypeScript paths.

**4. Flat Config vs Legacy Config**

If you are using ESLint v9 (Flat Config), follow the new flat config structure. Each package should have its own `eslint.config.js` that imports from your shared config[4][2]. If you are using legacy `.eslintrc.js`, ensure each package extends the shared config and sets the correct `parserOptions`.

| Issue                                  | Solution                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESLint config not applied in packages  | Each package needs its own `eslint.config.js` or `.eslintrc.js`  |
| Editor not showing lint errors         | Set `eslint.workingDirectories` in `.vscode/settings.json`       |
| TypeScript path aliases not resolved   | Use `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` and correct `tsconfig`   |
| TypeScript rules not working in editor | Set `parserOptions.project` and `tsconfigRootDir` in each config |
