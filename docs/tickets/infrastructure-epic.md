# 🏗️ Epic: Infrastructure & Deployment Modernization

**Epic ID:** INFRA-001  
**Created:** 2025-05-27  
**Status:** ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - In Progress  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Modernize deployment infrastructure to support production-ready builds, containerization, and automated testing for the Next.js/Fastify monorepo.

**✅ Phase 1 (Stabilization) - COMPLETED**
- Render app services deployment working
- Team unblocked for immediate deployments
- Dynamic service references implemented
- Health monitoring operational

**🔄 Phase 2 (Modernization) - NEXT**
- Docker containerization for production builds
- Performance optimization
- Staging environment setup

## Goals

- ✅ Stable production deployments
- 🔄 Proper build optimization 
- 📋 Automated testing pipeline
- 📋 Scalable infrastructure

## Background

The current Render deployment using app services has several limitations:
- ✅ ~~Requires dev dependencies during build for workspace linking~~ (WORKING)
- ✅ ~~Complex build configuration with pnpm global setup~~ (RESOLVED)
- 🔄 Limited control over production optimization (NEXT: Docker)
- 📋 No automated testing pipeline (PLANNED)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments (ACHIEVED)
- 🔄 Build times under 5 minutes (IN PROGRESS - currently ~6-8 minutes)
- ✅ 99%+ deployment success rate (ACHIEVED)
- 📋 Automated test coverage >80% (PLANNED)
- ✅ Team can deploy confidently without manual verification (ACHIEVED)

### INFRA-002: Complete Render App Services Deployment

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Assignee:** Ryan Vice  
**Completed:** 2025-05-27

#### Description
Finalize the current Render deployment using app services to get the team unblocked for immediate deployments.

#### Current Status
- ✅ Repository migration completed
- ✅ Build system configured with Turborepo
- ✅ Workspace dependency linking resolved
- ✅ Network binding fixed for web service
- ✅ Dynamic service references implemented
- ✅ **Final deployment verification completed**
- ✅ **Both services deployed and healthy**

#### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Both web and API services deploy successfully via render.yaml
- ✅ Services can communicate using dynamic service references
- ✅ Health checks pass for both services
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Team can deploy changes without manual intervention

#### Technical Implementation
- Using `NODE_ENV=development` during build for workspace linking
- Web service: `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` for proper network binding
- API service: Standard Fastify configuration
- Dynamic URLs via `fromService` configuration
- Fixed API URL construction in web app health checks

#### Key Issues Resolved
1. **Turbo Command Not Found** - Fixed pnpm global installation with proper PATH setup
2. **Workspace Dependencies** - Resolved TypeScript config linking issues
3. **Network Binding** - Fixed Next.js to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
4. **Service Communication** - Implemented dynamic service references
5. **Health Check URLs** - Fixed API endpoint path construction

#### Deployment URLs
- **Web Service**: https://web-ubxh.onrender.com
- **API Service**: https://api-82a7.onrender.com

#### Known Limitations (To be addressed in INFRA-003)
- Currently using dev dependencies during build (temporary solution)
- Larger build artifacts due to dev dependencies
- Longer build times than optimal

### INFRA-003: Migrate to Docker-based Deployment

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Status:** Backlog  
**Assignee:** TBD  

#### Description
Replace current app services with Docker containers to enable proper production builds and better resource management.

#### Benefits
- Proper separation of build vs runtime dependencies
- Better resource utilization
- Consistent environments across dev/staging/prod
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Smaller production images
- Better security (no build tools in production)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for web and API services
- [ ] Implement proper production builds (no dev dependencies in runtime)
- [ ] Configure Docker builds in render.yaml
- [ ] Optimize build times with proper layer caching
- [ ] Maintain or improve deployment speed
- [ ] Document Docker setup for local development
- [ ] Verify all environment variables work correctly
- [ ] Test service-to-service communication

#### Technical Considerations

**Multi-stage Build Strategy:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
# Install all dependencies including dev
# Build with Turborepo
# Generate production artifacts

# Runtime stage  
FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
# Copy only production artifacts
# Install only production dependencies
# Configure for production
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Turborepo cache optimization in Docker layers
- Workspace dependency handling in containerized builds
- Proper .dockerignore configuration
- Health check configuration in containers
- Environment variable management

#### Migration Plan
1. Create Dockerfiles for both services
2. Test locally with Docker Compose
3. Update render.yaml for Docker builds
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Performance testing and optimization
6. Production deployment
7. Monitor and iterate

### INFRA-004: Implement Integration Test Pipeline

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Status:** Backlog  
**Assignee:** TBD  

#### Description
Add automated integration testing to ensure deployments work correctly and catch issues before production.

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- API health checks and core endpoints
- Web application loads and renders correctly
- Database connectivity and migrations
- Inter-service communication
- Environment variable configuration
- Authentication flows
- Error handling

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up integration test framework
- [ ] Create tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create tests for web application functionality
- [ ] Test service-to-service communication
- [ ] Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure test environment in Render
- [ ] Add test reporting and notifications
- [ ] Document test setup and maintenance

#### Technical Implementation

**Testing Stack:**
- **API Testing:** Supertest or similar for HTTP endpoint testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for web application testing
- **Database Testing:** Test database seeding and cleanup
- **Service Testing:** Health checks and inter-service communication

**Test Environment:**
- Dedicated test database
- Test-specific environment variables
- Isolated test data
- Automated cleanup between test runs

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Run tests on every PR
- Block deployments on test failures
- Generate test reports
- Slack/email notifications for failures

#### Test Categories

**Unit Tests (existing):**
- Individual function testing
- Component testing
- Utility function testing

**Integration Tests (new):**
- API endpoint testing with real database
- Service-to-service communication
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Database operations and migrations

**End-to-End Tests (new):**
- Full user workflows
- Cross-service functionality
- UI interactions and flows
- Performance and load testing

## Dependencies

- **INFRA-002** must complete before **INFRA-003**
- **INFRA-004** can run in parallel with **INFRA-003**
- Database migrations may be needed for test environment

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk:** Docker migration causes deployment downtime  
**Mitigation:** Blue-green deployment strategy, thorough staging testing

**Risk:** Integration tests are flaky or slow  
**Mitigation:** Proper test isolation, parallel test execution, retry mechanisms

**Risk:** Team unfamiliarity with Docker  
**Mitigation:** Documentation, training sessions, gradual rollout
